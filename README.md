## Introduction

This starter template allows you to quickly scaffold a new Laravel web application using some of the most popular frameworks and libraries like:

- Laravel - A popular PHP web application framework. Laravel is known for its elegant syntax, great documentation and amazing community support. It makes building robust and scalable web applications a breeze.

- Jetstream - Provides authentication, registration and account management screens out of the box. Jetstream takes the pain out of building the boring but essential parts of a web app like user registration and login.

- Inertia.js - Allows building single page apps in a way that feels like a multi-page app. Inertia.js brings the best of both worlds for building interactive UIs that also have great SEO on the server-side.

- Vue.js - A progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Vue is loved for its approachablity and flexibility. The virtual DOM makes it really fast too.

- Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development. With Tailwind you can build custom designs without fighting CSS specificity issues.

- Vuetify - Material Design component framework for Vue.js. Vuetify components help you quickly build beautiful material-inspired interfaces.

Together these tools allow you to build a robust, secure and good-looking web app really quickly. The combination of Laravel and Vue.js is especially powerful in 2022.

## Differences Features with Original One

I have made several exciting changes compared to the original Laravel Jetstream template to make this starter template more visually appealing and user friendly:

- Redesigned the default Jetstream authentication screens with a sleek, modern layout using custom Tailwind CSS and Vuetify components. The login, register and password reset pages now have a premium theme-like style.

- Swapped out some of the standard Tailwind CSS form controls, buttons and other elements with matching Vuetify components. This gives the app a more polished and consistent look.

- Created a new main dashboard page with material design cards, charts and metrics for an at-a-glance overview. Replaced the default home page.

- Changed the overall application layout to use a clean vertical nav menu on the left instead of top navigation. Also added some nice custom components like user avatar and notifications.

- Added several example page templates like settings, profile, tasks etc to demonstrate different layouts and UI elements.

- Configured Vuetify theme colors and custom CSS to complement the Tailwind defaults. Achieved a cohesive material design styling throughout.

- Set up Vuex for state management instead of relying solely on local component state. Great for scaling up bigger apps.

- And more! Explore the code to see all the changes.
